# Time and money.

## Idea : 

The correct logical answer to a problem does not solve it all. Using logic always implies to reduce a problem scope. 

Where many of our today problems are more about a feeling small, or useless in the big world machine. 
Is there a mathematical scope for those who feel sad or useless. 

## Story :


### Panel 1:

*Lenny walking in the street.*

### Panel 2:

*Lenny stops next to a donuts shop.*  
`Lenny[thinking]` — My wallet fells like that.

### Panel 3:

*Lenny comes across his friend Sally in the street.*

### Panel 4:

`Sally` Hey Lenny, how have you been.  
`Lenny` Well… not bad, what about you?  
`Sally` Awesome, I haven’t been that good in years.

### Panel 5:

*Lenny smiles they look down.*

### Panel 6:

`Sally` You seem worried what happened?    
`Lenny` Nothing…

### Panel 7:

*Sally moves her bag from one shoulder to the other.*

### Panel 8:

`Sally` Come on, we’re not strangers.

### Panel 9:

*Lenny moves his eyes from the floor and looks at Sally with fear in his eyes.*

### Panel 10:

`Lenny` … I am just broke and I don’t know what to do.

### Panel 11:

*Sally joins her arms thinking of what to say, she kind of moved by him.*

### Panel 12:

*silence* 

### Panel 13:

`Sally(speaks fast)` — I just quitted my job, I’am broke too.  
`Lenny(astonished)` — How come, you where making big money.  
`Sally(kind of proud)` — I burned most of it, I was bored like hell working.

### Panel 14:

`Sally(kind of proud)` — I am planing to open a restaurant.  
`Lenny` And how do you manage with money ?  
`Sally` I just divided what I got left in 12. I got one year to try.

### Panel 15:

`Lenny(Surprised)` — That’s nice ! Tell me.

### Panel 16:

`Sally` I just got the name : « La bouche joyeuse ». The happy mouth in french.  
`Lenny(laughing)` — Sorry, but … it sound’s like porn.

### Panel 17:

`Sally(disgusted)` — … Really ?!  
`Lenny(shameful)` — Uh … The translation does.

### Panel 18:

`Sally(winks)` — Anyway. It make sense for a French restaurant.

### Panel 19:

*Lenny steps back feeling the urge to go.*

### Panel 20:

`Lenny(shy)` Nice seeing you, good luck with your nice plan.  
`Sally(sad)` Take care… call me someday.

### Panel 21:

`Lenny thinking` : Divide the money, that’s the thing. I’ll make it!

### Panel 22:

*One week later.*

### Panel 23:

*Lenny walking in the street.(same as panel 1)*

### Panel 24:

Lenny thinking : Still broke, and doing nothing but counting my money.

### Panel 25:

*Lenny calling Sally. The phone rings…*

### Panel 26:

`Sally` Hi Lenny, how have you been ?  
`Lenny` Not that good, I’d say.

### Panel 27:

*silence*

### Panel 28:

`Sally` Did you see your Friends lately ?  
`Lenny` Not really I was busy.

### Panel 29:

`Sally(cynical)` Are you busy now ?  
`Lenny(desperate)` I can’t afford being busy.
`Sally` So you have time to see your friends.  

### Panel 30:

*silence*

### Panel 31:

`Lenny(faking a good mood)` Was good to come across you the other day, it's nice what you are doing.  
`Sally(happy)` Thank you. What would you like to do, if you were to change job ?

### Panel 32:

`Lenny(felling lost)` That’s a good question… I don’t know.

### Panel 33:

`Sally(playful)` You told me you're not busy so you have time ?  
`Lenny(upset)` Yes since I can’t afford anything.

### Panel 34:

`Sally(more playful)` Knowing what to do is a question that takes time.  
`Lenny(more upset)` Well I have now two problems, no money, and I don’t know what to do.

### Panel 35:

`Sally(proud of her)` No money gives you time. Knowing what you do needs time.  
`Lenny(angry)` I could have found it myself, but you’re wrong because time is money.

### Panel 36:

`Sally(laughing)` Let’s go for a walk, luckily this time we’ll find a lonely piece of money.  
`Lenny(feeling a bit better)` You’re right, I’d be happy to meet you.
