# Time and money.

## Idea : 

The correct logical answer to a problem does not solve it all. Using logic always implies to reduce a problem scope. 
Where many of our today problems are more about a feeling small, or useless in the big world machine. 
Is there a mathematical scope for those who feel sad or useless.
