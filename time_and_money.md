# Time and money.

## Idea : 

The correct logical answer to a problem does not solve it all. Using logic always implies to reduce a problem scope. 

Where many of our today problems are more about a feeling small, or useless in the big world machine. 
Is there a mathematical scope for those who feel sad or useless. 

Lenny is broke and does not know hows to handle it. He cames across his old friend Sally which just changed her life style to open a restaurant. He tries to solve his money problems with better accounting but it's a failure. 
realizeLost and depressed he calls Sally. She makes him realize that money is the his problem, he is just lost because he does not know what to do in his life.
