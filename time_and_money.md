# Time and money.

## Idea : 

The correct logical answer to a problem does not solve it all. Using logic always implies to reduce a problem scope. 

Where many of our today problems are more about a feeling small, or useless in the big world machine. 
Is there a mathematical scope for those who feel sad or useless. 

## Story :

`Lenny` And how do you manage with money ?  
`Sally` I just divided what I got left in 12. I got one year to try.

### Panel 16:

`Lenny(Surprised)` — That’s nice ! Tell me.

### Panel 17:

`Sally` I just got the name : « La bouche joyeuse ». The happy mouth in french.  
`Lenny(laughing)` — Sorry, but … it sound’s like porn.

### Panel 18:

`Sally(disgusted)` — … Really ?!  
`Lenny(shameful)` — Uh … The translation does.

### Panel 19:

`Sally(winks)` — Anyway. It make sense for a French restaurant.

### Panel 27:

`Molly` Hi Lenny, how have you been ?  
`Lenny` Not that good, I’d say.

### Panel 28:

*silence*

### Panel 29:

`Molly` What is the matter ?  
`Lenny` I am broke. I am struggling not to spend the few money I got left.  
`Molly` That’s not easy, you call me after so long, because you feel bad ?

### Panel 30:

*silence*

### Panel 31:

`Molly` Did you see your Friends lately ?  
`Lenny` Not really I was busy.

### Panel 32:

`Molly(speaking fast)` Are you busy now ?  
`Lenny(desperate)` I can’t afford being busy.

### Panel 33:

`Molly(synical)` So you can see your friends.  
`Lenny(felling attacked)` I am calling you right now.  
`Molly(indifferent)` Yes, because you are broke, at least it gave me the opportunity to hear about you.

### Panel 34:

*silence*

### Panel 35:

`Molly(upset)` — I hope I am not the only one…  
`Lenny(faking a good mood)` - I saw Sally the other day.

### Panel 36:

`Molly(happy)` How is she ?  
`Lenny` Kind of good, she just quitted her job. She want’s to open a French restaurant. She already found the name : «La bouche joyeuse».  
`Molly(happy)` Nice to hear. I wish I had her courage. What would you like to do, if you were to change job ?

### Panel 37:

`Lenny(felling lost)` That’s a good question… I don’t know.

### Panel 38:

`Molly(playful)` You told me you had time.  
`Lenny(upset)` Yes since I can’t afford anything.

### Panel 39:

`Molly(more playful)` What to do is a question that takes time.  
`Lenny(more upset)` Well I have now two problems, no money, and I don’t know what to do.

### Panel 40:

`Molly(proud of her)` No money gives you time. Knowing what you do needs time.  
`Lenny(angry)` I could have found it myself, but you’re wrong because time is money.

### Panel 41:

`Molly(laughing)` Let’s go for a walk, luckily this time we’ll find a lonely piece of money.  
`Lenny(feeling a bit better)` You’re right, I’d be happy to meet you.
